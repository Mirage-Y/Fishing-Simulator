# Fishing-Simulator
This Python script simulates a fishing business over multiple years. Each year, the focus is on Salmon or Crabs, and the profit is determined by random chance. The manager retires if total profit becomes negative, exceeds $250,000, or after five consecutive years of positive profit. It uses one input (year number).
